# LINKS

Hello there :D, here are some links that i used to use when i am learning OS.<br>

1. [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)<br>
This website is mainly for security, but it also include linux usage.
If you also wanted to learn about security this website is highly reccomended as it has it's own virtual machine (sadly you have to subsrcibe in order to gain full access to it). 

2. (Another link soon will be added, stay tuned )
